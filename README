NAME
    Mousse - A Light and Tasty Moose for CPAN Authors

STATUS
    This is a very early release of Mousse for developers to play with and
    comment on. Even though the design of Mousse is very straightforward,
    please wait a release or two for anything beyond a taste test.

SYNOPSIS
    In your "Makefile.PL":

        use inc::Module::Install;
        name 'Chocolate';
        use_mousse 'Chocolate::Mousse';

    then in "lib/Chocolate/Jesus.pm":

        package Chocolate::Jesus;
        use Chocolate::Mousse;

        has 'forgiveness', is => 'ro';

    and:

        package Chocolate::Jeebus;
        use Chocolate::Mousse;

        extends 'Chocolate::Jesus';

        has 'whiskers', is => 'rw';

DESCRIPTION
    Mousse is the easiest way to get Moose support for your OO CPAN module.

    Mousse adds NO prerequisite dependencies to your CPAN module.

    Mousse has the same performance qualities as the zippy Mouse::Tiny.

    Mousse is enabled by adding one line to your Makefile.PL.

WHENCE MOUSSE?
    If you are a CPAN module author, you need to weigh the benefit of using
    Moose against the startup performance hit and sizable module
    prerequisite dependency. Should your simple module even use OO? Should
    you force a Moose dependency on every other module or project that uses
    your module? Should roll your own OO code and pass up the robustness of
    Moose? These questions grate on the concious of many CPAN authors.

    No longer!

    You've probably heard of Mouse. Mouse is a way to do all the core Moose
    functionality but without the performance costs. Mouse::Tiny puts all
    the Mouse modules into one module, but you still have a dependency on
    Mouse::Tiny. One solution is to copy Mouse::Tiny as your own module's OO
    base. But then you have to repeat that every time a new Mouse version is
    released.

    Another solution is to use Mousse! Mousse will remake your OO base
    module from the current version of Mousse have installed, every time you
    run "perl Makefile.PL".

MOUSSE FEATURES AND ADVANTAGES
  Mousse IS Mouse
    To learn about the features of Mousse (i.e. your generated Mousse-based
    OO module), simply read Mouse.

    Mousse is an exact copy of Mouse::*. It uses the same build process as
    Mouse::Tiny does, except that it names the resulting module whatever you
    want to call it. For example, if you use this line in your Makefile.PL:

        use_mousse 'Foo::Widget::OO';

    then Mousse::Maker will *whip up* a "lib/Foo/Widget/OO.pm" file for you
    from the Mousse.pm installed on your system.

    Alternatively, if you use *this* line in your Makefile.PL:

        use_mousse_dev 'Foo::Widget::OO';

    then Mousse::Maker will create a "lib/Foo/Widget/OO.pm" file for you
    from the *Mouse* parts installed on your system.

  No Dependency Hell Issues
    When you distribute a module that uses Mousse for OO, you can be assured
    that you have coded and tested against the exact copy of Mousse that
    your users will be running with. When a Mousse related bug is found, you
    can simply ship a new copy of your code (with the repaired copy of
    Mousse) and be certain that nobody will be trampled by a wild Moose.

  Using Mousse without Module::Install
    If you don't use Module::Install for your Makefile.PL, or if you want to
    only update Mousse by hand, you can use this simple command:

        perl -MMousse::Maker -e make_mousse 'Chocolate::Mousse' > lib/Chocolate/Mousse.pm

  You Can Use Mousse as a Prerequisite
    If you don't care about adding a dependency and you don't want to ship
    your own copy of Mousse, you can use it just like Mouse::Tiny.

RESOURCES
    The Mousse module can be found on CPAN and on GitHub:
